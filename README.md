Sprinkle
======
Sprinkle is a toolkit built with the intention of making the asynchronous programming easy and mainstream by leveraging Java 8 functional capabilities(lambdas, completable futures) and functional thinking (monads, monoids, functors). It borrows ideas from Scala core libraries, and multiple Scala toolkits - like Spray(http://spray.io/) and Akka(http://akka.io/).

Furthermore, Sprinkle is non-intrusive - it does not force you to change your existing code, does not take over your application by forcing you to implement certain interfaces and inherit classes - it is based solely on function compositions. 

### Using Sprinkle library
Use the following to include Sprinkle dependency in your project POM file:
```

### Quick start and examples
Run the examples from the project root directory with the following command:

Check [PipelineServer.java](examples/src/main/java/org/sprinkle/examples/PipelineServer.java) as an example that demonstrates the complete capabilities of the toolkit.
For additional information take a look at the [demo guide](DEMO.md).
